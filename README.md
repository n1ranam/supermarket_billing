# Supermarket

The E Mart Supermarket is a Billing Management desktop application developed using the JDBC 
platform. The system automates the process of generating invoices and managing sales data for a 
supermarket, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of billing operations while reducing the 
workload of supermarket staff. The system allows the admin to add, edit, delete and view product 
stock, add categories of products and also add sellers. The seller can log in to the system using 
their login credentials and enter the details of the purchased product into the billing form, resulting 
in the generation of a bill based on the entered product details. Simultaneously, the product stock 
will be updated based on the purchase, making it an effective solution for managing inventory in 
a supermarket.
